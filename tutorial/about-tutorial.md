# Tutorial templates

## Why do I need tutorials?

Tutorials are integral to helping your users become acquainted with your product. They are learning-oriented, which means that they teach users how to do something, like learning how to debug a JavaScript application.

Tutorials are often confused with how-to guides because they do help users achieve a specific end. However, how-to guides assume that your users have some experience with your product or are familiar with the basics.

In comparison, tutorials help beginners understand the concepts they need to use your product and understand the rest of the your documentation.

## Overview of the tutorial templates

There are three types of tutorial templates included in this directory: a quickstart tutorial template, a modular tutorial template, and a deep dive tutorial template.

The [quickstart tutorial template](quickstart-tutorial/about-quickstart-tutorial.md) is installation-focused and guides your user through installing your product and completing a small project to verify installation. 

The [modular tutorial](modular-tutorial/about-modular-tutorial.md) template provides a walkthrough of a particular feature. It's for users who have completed the quickstart tutorial.

The [deep dive tutorial](deep-dive-tutorial/about-deep-dive-tutorial.md) template provides users the opportunity to learn more about a particular feature. It builds upon the knowledge learned in the modular tutorial. This tutorial can present learners with a hypothetical scenario or provide a starter project to help guide their learning.
