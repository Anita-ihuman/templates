# The tutorial template 

The tutorial template includes placeholder text that you can replace with your own text. This text is indicated in {curly braces}.

## Why do I need tutorials?

Tutorials are integral to helping your users become acquainted with your product. They are learning-oriented, which means that they teach users how to do something, like learning how to debug a JavaScript application. 

Tutorials are often confused with how-to guides because they do help users achieve a specific end. However, how-to guides assume that your users have some experience with your product or are familiar with certain concepts. 

In comparison, tutorials help beginners understand the concepts they need to use your product and understand the rest of your documentation. 

## About the tutorial template 

This tutorial can be used in one of two ways: for providing a walkthrough of a particular feature, or walking users through completing a small project. Ideally, your users already completed a quickstart or "getting started" tutorial and have a general understanding of your product. 

### About the "Overview" section

Use this section to provide an overview of what learning objectives or goals users will complete in this tutorial. You can also explicitly state who this tutorial is for and what required background knowledge is needed. 

### About the "Background" section

The purpose of the background section is to provide any necessary context for your users before they start your tutorial. 

If you're writing a tutorial that's focused on learning how a particular feature works, you might describe that feature here. For example, a tutorial around using Microsoft Visio's templates to build flowcharts might start with an explanation of how flowcharts are used or what flowchart shapes represent. 

If you're writing a tutorial where you provide users with a starter project, you could describe the project hierarchy here. For example, a tutorial around building a website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript might explain how the folders are organized, what code is provided for the user, or what they need to add.

### About the "Before you begin" section

Use this section to list any prerequisites for completing the tutorial. This may include operating systems, languages, package managers, or software.

### About the "Steps" section

The steps section is where you describe what the user needs to do. How you write your steps will vary depending on your organization's style guide. 

This template breaks down the tutorial into _parts_. One _part_ of the tutorial may focus on completing several related steps. You're welcome to follow this structure or use the step headings on their own.

#### Tips for writing steps in a tutorial

* When writing your steps, make sure to provide any background information your users may need to complete the task. 
* Remember to orient your users when walking them through each step. If they need to open a particular file or dialog to complete the task, provide that information first.

### About the "Summary" section

Use the summary section of the tutorial to sum up what tasks your user completed during the tutorial and what your users now know how to do.

### About the "Next Steps" section

Use this section to include links to other tutorials, such as tutorials that allow users to learn about other features. You can also include links to relevant resources, like articles, blogs, or videos.

## Helpful tips when writing your tutorial 

* Keep your tutorial focused. If needed, link out to other pieces of documentation that might explain some concept in more depth.
