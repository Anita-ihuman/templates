# The tutorial template

The tutorial template includes:

* Placeholder text that you can replace with your own text. This text is indicated in {curly braces}.
* Writing instructions, also in {curly braces}.

## Why do I need tutorials?

Tutorials are integral to helping your users become acquainted with your product. They are learning-oriented, which means that they teach users how to do a practical task, like debugging a JavaScript application. 

Tutorials are often confused with how-to guides because they help users achieve a specific goal. However, how-to guides assume that your users have some experience with your product or are familiar with certain concepts. 

In comparison, tutorials give your users hands-on experience with your product so that they can understand key concepts about your product in a more practical context. Hands-on learning often helps learners gain a deeper understanding of the product by helping them see how they can use a tool to accomplish a task they care about.

## About the tutorial template 

This tutorial can be used in one of two ways: 
* For providing a walkthrough of a particular feature
* Walking users through completing a small project. 

Ideally, your users already completed a quickstart or "getting started" tutorial and have a general understanding of your product.  

### About the "Overview" section

The overview section is important, as it can motivate your users to begin their learning journey with your product and help set them up for success. There are three topics you should cover in this section: learning objectives, intended audience, and any prerequisite background knowledge. 

One of the first things users want to know when they begin a tutorial is, "What will I be able to do? What knowledge will I gain by completing this tutorial?" Well-written learning objectives can help to answer these questions. **Learning objectives** describe the specific skills or knowledge users will be able to demonstrate after completing your tutorial.

Before you start writing your tutorial, develop some learning objectives. After you identify *what* skills and knowledge you want users to gain from your tutorial, you can start planning out the content itself, using the learning objectives to help you decide what topics are in scope, and which ones are out of scope. 

Learning objectives usually start off with, "By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to...", are followed by a phrase that starts with a verb like *design*, *assess*, or *develop*.

Here are some examples:

* By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to define components in React
* By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to perform common tasks in Google Drive, such as viewing, editing, and saving documents
* By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to create a private channel in Slack

### About the "Background" section

The purpose of the background section is to provide any necessary context for your users before they start your tutorial. 

If you're writing a tutorial that's focused on learning how a particular feature works, you might describe that feature here. For example, a tutorial around using Microsoft Visio's templates to build flowcharts might start with an explanation of how flowcharts are used or what flowchart shapes represent. 

If you're writing a tutorial where you provide users with a starter project, you could describe the project hierarchy here. For example, a tutorial around building a website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript might explain how the folders are organized, what code is provided for the user, or what they need to add.

### About the "Before you begin" section

Use this section to list any prerequisites for completing the tutorial. This may include operating systems, languages, package managers, or software.

### About the "Steps" section

The steps section is where you describe what the user needs to do. How you write your steps will vary depending on your organization's style guide. 

This template breaks down the tutorial into _parts_. One _part_ of the tutorial may focus on completing several related steps. You're welcome to follow this structure or use the step headings on their own.

#### Tips for writing steps in a tutorial

* When writing your steps, make sure to provide any background information your users may need to complete the task. 
* Remember to orient your users when walking them through each step. If they need to open a particular file or dialog to complete the task, provide that information first.
* Start your step heading with a verb. Make sure to use the base form of the verb (for example, "Create", "Migrate", "Remove"). Verbs that end in -ing (for example, "Creating", "Migrating", "Removing") are harder to translate.

### About the "Summary" section

Use the summary section of the tutorial to sum up what tasks your user completed during the tutorial and what your users now know how to do.

### About the "Next Steps" section

Use this section to include links to other tutorials, such as tutorials that allow users to learn about other features. You can also include links to relevant resources, like articles, blogs, or videos.

## Helpful tips when writing your tutorial 

* Keep your tutorial focused. If needed, include links to other pieces of documentation that explain concepts or terms in more depth.
* If users will copy and paste code samples, make sure they include the following:
  * Any required `import` or `using` statements
  * Code comments that explain what the code does 
* Lengthy tutorials can overwhelm users. Consider condensing or removing steps or reevaluating the scope of the tutorial.
